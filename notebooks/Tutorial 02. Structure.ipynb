Create your own configuration files for your experiments, such that you can evaluate your approaches on Vanilla Athena by providing corresponding json files we provided. ``demo`` folder contains the configurations (smaller scale) for tutorials.\n",

You will need this file model and transformation related tasks, for example, load a model, transform an image, etc.\n",
    "2. ``data-mnist.json`` describes the information related to test data. It consits of the folder to store the test data (``dir``), the benign sample (``bs_file``), the corresponding true labels (``label_file``), and the adversarial examples (``ae_files``). You will need it for almost all tasks like evaluate a model, generate adversarial example, etc. **You do NOT need it when you train a model.**\n",
    "3. ``model-mnist.json`` defines the information related to trained models. The folder where the trained models locate (``dir``), the undefended model (``um_file``), the prefix and postfix of the model names (check models/cnn/readme.md for the naming patterns). You will need it when you load a trained model.\n",
    "4. ``attack-zk-mnist.json`` define the attack configurations, in a similar structure of ``athena-mnist.json``. ``num_attacks`` defines the total number of attacks, ``configs<n>`` defines the adversarial settings for each attack."
